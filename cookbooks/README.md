Berkshelf Managed Cookbooks
===========================


Normally this directory would contain all the cookbooks used to manage your infrastructure.

However because this repository is currently using Bershelf to manage cookbooks this directory should container only custom `jmh-` prefixed cookbooks. They must be added to the Berksfile in the top level directory.

See https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf for more information
